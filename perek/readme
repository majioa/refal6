Perek.exe is universal encoder/decoder.
It performs arbitrary byte-by-byte decoding (perekodirovka) of any file.
It uses two code tables, one for source (from.abc) and one for target (to.abc).
Each code table is a text file which contains all symbols to be transformed.
Both tables should contain identical texts, each in its own coding.

Usage:

perek from.abc to.abc source target

(transforms from KOI-8 to DOS alternative coding)

perek altgraph.abc win.abc source target

(transforms from DOS alternative with pseudographics to Windows)
